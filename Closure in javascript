Closure:-

A closure is a function that retains access to its outer function's variables, even after the outer function has finished executing. 
It "remembers" the environment in which it was created, allowing it to access variables outside its immediate scope.

function outer() {
    let outerVar = "I'm in the outer scope!";
    function inner() {
        console.log(outerVar); 
        outerVar = "Updated"
    }
    return inner;  
}
const closure = outer(); 
closure();
closure();

output:-
I'm in the outer scope!
Updated

In this example
The function inner() forms a closure by retaining access to outerVar, which is a variable in the scope of outer().
Even though outer() has completed execution, inner() still has access to outerVar due to the closure.
